Complication to open the app drawer or start Google Assistant for Android Wear watches running Wear 2.0 that do not have a hardware button such as LG G Watch running Lenok2Dory Wear 2.0 ROM or other Wear 2.0 ports for unsupported watches (eg: Gear Live, ZenWatch 1).

It can also be used as a replacement of your wear 2.0 watch's physical button (if its broken for example)

### Complications:

* Wearbttn: opens app drawer (REQUIRES ROOT)
* Google Assistant: Opens google assistant

### Root access:

Only the app drawer complication requires root access. Root access for LG G Watch running Lenok2dory can be achieved using [this method](https://forum.xda-developers.com/g-watch/development/guide-how-to-root-lg-g-watch-6-0-1-t3320512)

It may take 2 taps to open the app drawer.
